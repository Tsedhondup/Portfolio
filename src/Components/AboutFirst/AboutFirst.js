              'My earliest quest for a career began at the University of Delhi,
              where I studied plant biology, ecology, and genetics. Their
              education includes rigorous coursework, laboratory work, and field
              research, developing a strong foundation in scientific analysis
              and research methodologies'

              self-taught software developer. As influential and inspiring as
              the video was, I was rather excited to learn coding as a hobby and
              feed my curiosities.'

              be my greatest strength in keeping up with ever-changing
              technologies that are paramount. However, the need for a proper
              mentor to assist in honing my skills tailored to professional
              requirements was vital. I take pride in investing time and
              resources in joining the Software Engineering Boot Camp at
              BrainStation, Toronto'

              As a full-stack developer, I aim to secure a role in a dynamic
              tech company to enhance my skills in modern frameworks. I plan to
              continuously improve my knowledge through advanced courses,
              certifications, and hands-on projects. My long-term goal is to
              grow into a senior developer role and mentor others.
